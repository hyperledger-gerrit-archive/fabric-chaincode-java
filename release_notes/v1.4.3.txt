v1.4.3 July 31, 2019
----------------------------

Release Notes
-------------
This is a bug fix release for some contract issue on top the previous v1.4.2 release.

When chaincode is rebuilt when building the docker container, the tests phases will not
be run; this took noteable extra time for the more complex contracts.

Future releases will build on this preview; please experiement with this and provide feedback.
(RocketChat and JIRA)
