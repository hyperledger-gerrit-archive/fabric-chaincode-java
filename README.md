# Hyperledger Fabric - Java Contracts

This is the project to support the writing of Contracts with the JVM runtime - enabling development of using Java language or other JVM based languages

Application developers interested in developing smart contracts (what we call chaincode) for Hyperledger Fabric should
read the tutorial in TUTORIAL.md file and visit
[Chaincode for developers](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode4ade.html).

As an application developer, to learn about how to implement **"Smart Contracts"** for Hyperledger Fabric using Java, please visit the [API documentation](https://fabric-chaincode-java.github.io/) - and follow the tutorial links. A [quick-start tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) is in this repo.

As a contributor looking to update this repo, please start with the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
